## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- GCC compiler
- Linux-based operating system

### Compilation and Execution
Each task can be compiled and run separately. Navigate to the `src` directory and use the following commands:

```bash
# Task 1
gcc -o task1 task1_process_termination.c
./task1

# Task 2
gcc -o task2 task2_shared_memory.c
./task2

# Task 3
gcc -o task3 task3_message_passing.c
./task3

# Race Condition Demo
gcc -o race race_condition.c
./race
